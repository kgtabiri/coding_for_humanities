# Second Week of Coding Workshop
This is the second week of Coding for Humanities workshop. It's been interesting so far.

Today we're learning about markdown. I do use markdown quite regularly, but today I learnt about *Markdown All in One*, which supposed make writing markdown in Visual Studio easier. I can now preview my markdown as I write!

We even got a link to a [markdown cheatsheet](https://dh-coding-docs.netlify.app/workshop-i/markdown-reference/) that is specific to the course. But there is also the ultimate [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

This is the list of software we have installed so far:
- Visual Studio
- Github
- Jupyter Notebook
